The purpose of this project is to re-build a simple google search home page. This is a project from The Odin Project under "Web Development
101" titled "Project: HTML/CSS"

The road so far:

So far, the Odin project seems to be going a long a lot better than others. Usually, you get through the basics then WHAM, something that
changes everything and doesn't make sense. Odin seems to be pacing a long really nicely and has a lot of good informaion and resources.

I'm becoming a lot more familiar with Linux/Ubuntu command line terminal, a tool that I really only used to use when I absolutyl had to and 
even then it was just copy/pasting what others had posted online and hoping it worked without knowing why. 

I have also become a lot more comfortable with CSS, especially DIV, ID, and Class. I have experimented with DIV in the past but got stuck
when I couldn't figure out how to have multiple DIVS act differently. Now I know that you label each with an ID to change how they act, not
just set a css rule for all DIV. 

The CSS grid system is brand new to me. I knew that web pages were designed in basically blocks with HTML (Which i've been using since 
middle school and Neopets.com) I just didn't know that CSS has tools to really help define the grid layout options.
